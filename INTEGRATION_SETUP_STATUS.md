## ⚠️ What's Needed: OAuth Credentials

You need to get API credentials from external platforms to enable connections.

## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Choose Platform(s) to Integrate
Pick one or more platforms to start with. We recommend starting with:
- **Xero** or **QuickBooks** (for financial data)
- **Slack** (easiest to test, immediate results)

### Step 2: Get OAuth Credentials
Follow the detailed instructions in **`OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** for your chosen platform(s).

**Example for Xero:**
1. Go to https://developer.xero.com/myapps
2. Create new app
3. Set redirect URI: `http://localhost:5173/integrations/callback`
4. Copy Client ID and Secret
5. Paste into `backend/.env`:
   ```bash
   XERO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   XERO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

### Step 3: Run Database Migrations
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations integrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_integration_providers
```

### Step 4: Test the Integration
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
python manage.py runserver

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev
```

Then visit: **http://localhost:5173/integrations**

### Step 5: Connect Your First Platform
1. Click "Connect" button on your chosen platform
2. You'll be redirected to the platform's authorization page
3. Approve the access
4. You'll be redirected back to the integrations page
5. Connection should show as "Active" 🟢
6. Click "Sync" to test data import

## 🔍 Quick Verification

Run this anytime to check your setup:
```bash
python check_integration_setup.py
```

This will show:
- ✅ Which files are in place
- ✅ Which environment variables are configured
- ⚠️ What still needs to be done

## 💡 Testing Tips

### Start with Slack (Easiest)
Slack is the quickest to set up and test:
1. Takes ~5 minutes to create app
2. No complex permissions
3. Immediate visual feedback (send message to channel)
4. Good for verifying OAuth flow works

### Test in Sandbox Mode
Most platforms offer sandbox/test environments:
- **Xero**: Demo Company (no real data)
- **QuickBooks**: QuickBooks Sandbox
- **Salesforce**: Developer Edition (free)
- **AWS**: Use separate test account

### Common First-Time Issues
1. **"Invalid redirect URI"** → Check URL matches exactly
2. **"Invalid credentials"** → Copy/paste carefully, check for spaces
3. **"Permission denied"** → Check OAuth scopes granted
4. **500 errors** → Restart Django server after adding .env vars

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ Integration page loads without errors
2. ✅ Platforms show "Connect" buttons
3. ✅ Clicking "Connect" redirects to OAuth page
4. ✅ After authorization, returns to integrations page
5. ✅ Connection shows "Active" status with green indicator
6. ✅ "Sync" button triggers data import
7. ✅ Sync log shows successful import

---

## 📞 Getting Help

### If OAuth Fails:
- Check `OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for platform-specific troubleshooting
- Verify redirect URI matches exactly
- Ensure environment variables loaded (restart server)

### If Data Sync Fails:
- Check Django console for error messages
- View sync logs in Admin panel
- Verify API permissions granted during OAuth

### Resources:
- **Technical Issues**: See `INTEGRATIONS_GUIDE.md` § Troubleshooting
- **OAuth Setup**: See `OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for your platform
- **Platform Docs**: Links in OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md § Support Resources

## 📈 What You Can Do After Setup

Once OAuth credentials are configured and connections established:

### Automatic Features:
- ✅ **Auto-sync** every 60 minutes (configurable)
- ✅ **Token refresh** before expiration
- ✅ **Data transformation** (financial → emissions)
- ✅ **Sync logging** (success/failure tracking)

### User Features:
- ✅ **Manual sync triggers**
- ✅ **Connection management** (disconnect/reconnect)
- ✅ **Sync history viewing**
- ✅ **Status monitoring**

### Data Flow:
```
External Platform → OAuth Connection → Auto Sync → 
Data Transformation → Carbon Emissions → Dashboard Updates
```

## 🎨 Current UI Features

The `/integrations` page now shows:
- ✅ List of available platforms (8 providers)
- ✅ Category filtering (Accounting, Cloud, CRM, etc.)
- ✅ Connection status indicators
- ✅ OAuth connection buttons
- ✅ Sync/Disconnect controls for active connections
- ✅ Loading and error states
- ✅ Real-time status updates
