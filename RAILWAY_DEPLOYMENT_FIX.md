# üöÄ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX GUIDE

## PROBLEM DIAGNOSED ‚úÖ
Your Railway deployment is showing a splash page instead of your Django app because:
1. Railway is not properly using the Dockerfile configuration
2. The Django application isn't running on the deployment

## IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 1: Redeploy on Railway
1. Go to your Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your SCN ESG Backend project
3. Go to the **Deployments** tab
4. Click **"Deploy"** to trigger a new deployment

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in Railway:
```
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DJANGO_DEBUG=False
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=*.railway.app,scn-esg-backend.railway.app
DATABASE_URL=your-railway-postgres-url
```

### Step 3: Monitor the Build Logs
1. In Railway, click on the latest deployment
2. Watch the **Build Logs** to see if there are any errors
3. Check the **Deploy Logs** to see if Django starts properly

### Step 4: Test the Fixed Deployment
After redeployment, test these endpoints:
- `https://scn-esg-backend.railway.app/api/v1/health/` (should return 200)
- `https://scn-esg-backend.railway.app/admin/` (should show Django admin)

## EXPECTED RESULTS ‚úÖ
After the fix:
- ‚úÖ Django admin should be accessible
- ‚úÖ API endpoints should return proper responses (not 404)
- ‚úÖ Your test users should be able to log in from the frontend

## TEST THE LOGIN AFTER FIX üß™
Use these credentials created by the debug script:

**Admin User:**
- Email: `admin@test.com`
- Password: `TestAdmin123!`

**Regular User:**
- Email: `user@test.com`  
- Password: `TestUser123!`

## TROUBLESHOOTING üîß
If the deployment still fails:

1. **Check Railway Logs**: Look for Python/Django errors in the build logs
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is connected properly
3. **Static Files**: Verify `collectstatic` runs successfully
4. **Port Configuration**: Make sure the app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`

## ALTERNATIVE: Quick Railway CLI Fix
If you have Railway CLI installed:
```bash
railway login
railway link [your-project-id]
railway deploy
```

---

**Next Step**: Once Railway is fixed and Django is running, your frontend login should work immediately since all the authentication is already properly implemented! üéâ
