### 3. Post-Onboarding Experience

#### What Standard Users See
After completing onboarding, you'll have:

‚úÖ **Clean Dashboard**
- No pre-populated data (unlike demo account)
- Welcome message with your name
- Empty state cards prompting first actions
- Quick action buttons to get started

‚úÖ **Empty States with Guidance**
- **My Data Tab**: "No footprints yet. Click 'Calculate Footprint' to get started."
- **Footprint History**: "Your footprint history will appear here."
- **Smart Data Entry**: Ready to accept first conversational input

- Carbon Offset Marketplace
- Reports & Analytics
- CSRD Compliance tools
- AI Insights

#### Creating Your First Footprint

**Option A: Carbon Calculator** (Recommended)

   - Company name (pre-filled)
   - Reporting period (e.g., "2024")
   - Number of employees
   - Annual revenue
   - Scope 1 inputs (natural gas, heating oil, company vehicles)
   - Scope 2 inputs (electricity consumption, region)
   - Scope 3 inputs (business travel, commuting, waste)
3. Click "Calculate Emissions"
4. Review results showing scope breakdown
5. Click "Save Footprint" to persist data

**Option B: Smart Data Entry** (AI-Powered)
1. Navigate to "Smart Data Entry" tab
2. Type natural language like:
   - "We used 5000 kWh of electricity last month"
   - "Our fleet drove 10,000 miles this quarter"
   - "We generated 2 tons of waste"
3. AI extracts emissions data and suggests updates
4. Accept or reject AI suggestions
5. See live preview update in real-time
6. Data automatically saves

**Option C: Import Data** (Bulk Upload)

---

### 4. Data Persistence & LocalStorage

#### How Demo Mode Works
**Demo Account (`demo@scn.com`)**:
- ‚úÖ Auto-seeded with mockCarbonFootprint in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Shows 1357.8 tCO‚ÇÇe total (125.5 scope1, 340.2 scope2, 892.1 scope3)
- ‚úÖ Fallback data ensures demo always shows populated UI
- ‚úÖ API data takes precedence when available

#### How Standard Users Work
**New Registered Users**:
- ‚ùå NO auto-seeded demo data
- ‚úÖ Clean localStorage on registration
- ‚úÖ Empty states until first footprint created
- ‚úÖ localStorage fallback only triggers if they manually save data

#### Three-Tier Data Loading Strategy
All components use this fallback pattern:

1. **Primary**: Try API (`carbonService.getFootprints()`)
2. **Secondary**: Fall back to localStorage (`localStorage.getItem('carbonFootprint')`)
3. **Tertiary**: Show empty state or temp data

**Components with Fallback**:
- ‚úÖ UserDashboard (My Data tab)
- ‚úÖ FootprintHistory
- ‚úÖ ConversationalDataEntry (Smart Data Entry)
- ‚úÖ LiveFootprintPreview
- ‚úÖ CarbonCalculator (pre-population)
