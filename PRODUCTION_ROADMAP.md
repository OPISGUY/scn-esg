# SCN ESG Platform - Production Roadmap

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: Post-Alpha Planning  
**Goal**: Transform alpha platform into production-ready enterprise solution

---

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the path from alpha testing to production launch, focusing on essential features for enterprise deployment including self-hosted email infrastructure, user management, and multi-tenancy.

---

## Phase 1: Self-Hosted Email Infrastructure ‚è≥

**Goal**: Eliminate dependency on external paid email services (SendGrid/AWS SES) by hosting our own SMTP relay

### 1.1 Email Architecture Decision

#### Option A: Postfix SMTP Relay (Production Recommended) ‚úÖ
**Best for**: Production deployments with full control

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard, battle-tested MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)
- ‚úÖ Full control over delivery and reputation
- ‚úÖ No per-email costs
- ‚úÖ Excellent deliverability with proper configuration
- ‚úÖ SPF, DKIM, DMARC support
- ‚úÖ Can relay through upstream SMTP for better delivery

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires server with static IP
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DNS configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC records)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è IP reputation management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Server maintenance overhead

**Setup Complexity**: Medium  
**Cost**: $5-10/month VPS + domain  
**Time to Implement**: 2-3 hours

#### Option B: MailHog (Development Only) ‚úÖ
**Best for**: Local development and testing

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Zero configuration SMTP server
- ‚úÖ Web UI to view sent emails
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies
- ‚úÖ Perfect for testing flows

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Development only, not for production
- ‚ùå No actual email delivery
- ‚ùå No authentication

**Setup Complexity**: Trivial  
**Cost**: Free  
**Time to Implement**: 15 minutes

#### Option C: Self-Hosted Mailu/Mail-in-a-Box (Full Mail Server)
**Best for**: Organizations needing complete email infrastructure

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Complete mail server (SMTP + IMAP)
- ‚úÖ Web admin interface
- ‚úÖ User mailboxes
- ‚úÖ Spam filtering, antivirus

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è High complexity
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires dedicated server
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Significant maintenance overhead
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Overkill for transactional emails only

**Setup Complexity**: High  
**Cost**: $20+/month dedicated server  
**Time to Implement**: 4-8 hours

#### Recommended Approach: Hybrid Strategy ‚úÖ

**Development**: MailHog  
**Staging**: Postfix relay with test domain  
**Production**: Postfix relay OR managed SMTP relay (e.g., via your hosting provider)

- **Data Security**: Multi-company data leakage
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, row-level security, audit logging

### Medium Risk
- **Migration**: Moving from single to multi-company model
  - **Mitigation**: Careful migration scripts, backup strategy, rollback plan

- **Performance**: Permission checks on every request
  - **Mitigation**: Caching, database indexing, query optimization

### Low Risk
- **UI Complexity**: Too many features overwhelming users
  - **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure, optional features, good UX
