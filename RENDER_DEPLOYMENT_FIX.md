# Render Deployment Fix - October 6, 2025

## ❌ Problems (Sequential Failures)

### Issue 1: Missing Cryptography
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cryptography'
```

### Issue 2: Missing Stripe
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'stripe'
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
**Render-specific requirements files were out of sync with main requirements.txt**

The following packages were in `requirements.txt` but missing from `requirements.render.txt`:
1. `cryptography>=41.0.0` - Integration system encrypted storage
2. `requests>=2.31.0` - OAuth 2.0 HTTP requests
3. `stripe==11.1.0` - Payment/subscription system
4. `PyMuPDF>=1.24.0` - Document extraction feature
5. `sentry-sdk==1.39.1` - Error monitoring

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### Fix 1 - Commit `1d0d6e6`
Added to both `requirements.render.txt` and `requirements.py313.txt`:
```pip-requirements
# External Platform Integrations
cryptography>=41.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
```

### Fix 2 - Commit `d3dfcc9` (Complete Fix)
Added to both `requirements.render.txt` and `requirements.py313.txt`:
```pip-requirements
# Payment Integration
stripe==11.1.0

# Data processing (with document extraction)
PyMuPDF>=1.24.0

# Monitoring
sentry-sdk==1.39.1
```

## 📝 Final Commit Details
- **Commit:** `d3dfcc9`
- **Message:** "fix: Add stripe and PyMuPDF to Render requirements files"
- **Files Changed:** 
  - `backend/requirements.render.txt` (complete sync with main)
  - `backend/requirements.py313.txt` (complete sync with main)

## 🚀 Redeployment
- Push successful to `origin/main`
- Render will auto-detect the push and redeploy
- New build should succeed with cryptography installed

## 📋 Verification Steps

After Render redeploys:

1. **Check Build Logs** - Verify `cryptography` appears in installed packages:
   ```
   Installing collected packages: ... cryptography ...
   Successfully installed cryptography-41.x.x
   ```

2. **Check Migration Success**:
   ```
   Running migrations:
   Applying integrations.0001_initial... OK
   ```

3. **Verify Service Starts**:
   - No `ModuleNotFoundError`
   - Django loads successfully
   - API endpoints respond

## 🔄 Why This Happened

### Timeline:
1. Created integrations app with `cryptography` dependency
2. Added to `requirements.txt` (main file)
3. **Forgot to update** `requirements.render.txt` (Render-specific)
4. Render used `requirements.txt` which worked locally but build script might reference `.render.txt`

### Lesson:
When adding new Python dependencies, update **ALL** requirements files:
- ✅ `requirements.txt` (main)
- ✅ `requirements.render.txt` (Render deployment)
- ✅ `requirements.py313.txt` (Python 3.13 specific)
- ⚠️ `requirements.minimal.txt` (only if core dependency)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Render Build** - Should succeed now
2. **Verify Integration Models** - Check admin panel for new tables
3. **Test "Coming Soon" UI** - Ensure integrations page displays correctly
4. **Add Environment Variable** - Add `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to Render after successful deploy

## 📞 Support

If build still fails:
- Check Render build logs for other missing dependencies
- Verify Python version compatibility (3.13+)
- Ensure all INSTALLED_APPS are properly configured
- Check for import errors in other new files
