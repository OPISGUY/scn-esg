# Authentication & User Experience Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the critical implementation of the authentication system and user onboarding experience that must be completed before the SCN ESG Platform public launch.

## Current Status: CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED ⚠️

The platform currently uses a demo mode with role switching, which is inappropriate for production. We need a complete authentication and user experience overhaul.

## Phase 7.5: Production Authentication & User Experience

### 1. Authentication System Architecture

#### Backend Implementation (Django)
```python
# Priority API endpoints to implement:
POST /api/v1/auth/register/          # User registration
POST /api/v1/auth/login/             # User login
POST /api/v1/auth/logout/            # User logout
POST /api/v1/auth/refresh/           # Token refresh
POST /api/v1/auth/forgot-password/   # Password reset
POST /api/v1/auth/verify-email/      # Email verification
GET  /api/v1/auth/profile/           # User profile
PUT  /api/v1/auth/profile/           # Update profile
POST /api/v1/auth/change-password/   # Change password
```

#### Frontend Components to Build
```typescript
// Core authentication components:
- LoginPage.tsx              # Professional login interface
- SignupPage.tsx             # Multi-step registration
- ForgotPasswordPage.tsx     # Password recovery
- EmailVerificationPage.tsx  # Email confirmation
- ProfilePage.tsx            # User profile management
- AuthLayout.tsx             # Authentication wrapper
```

### 2. User Registration Flow

#### Step 1: Basic Information

**CRITICAL**: This phase must be completed before any public launch or marketing efforts. The current demo mode is unsuitable for production use and will result in poor user experience and potential security issues.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Prioritize this phase in the development timeline
2. Allocate dedicated development resources
3. Begin implementation immediately
4. Set up proper testing and QA processes
5. Plan for user feedback collection and iteration
