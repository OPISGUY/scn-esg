## 🚀 Quick Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add external platform integrations infrastructure (Coming Soon)

- Implemented complete Django integrations app with OAuth 2.0
- Added encrypted credential storage with Fernet
- Created platform-specific API clients (Xero, QuickBooks, AWS, Azure, GCP, Salesforce, Slack, Teams)
- Built REST API endpoints for connections and webhooks
- Implemented Celery tasks for auto-sync and token refresh
- Added frontend integration service and updated UI
- Marked all integrations as 'Coming Soon' until OAuth credentials configured
- Fixed 6 lint errors for production readiness
- Created comprehensive documentation and setup guides"

# 3. Push to production
git push origin main

# 4. Watch deployment
# Vercel will auto-deploy frontend from main branch
# Monitor at: https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments
```

---

## ⚠️ Post-Deployment Actions Required

### 1. Add Encryption Key to Production
The integrations system needs the encryption key in production:

**Vercel Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Navigate to: Project → Settings → Environment Variables
# Add:
INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<copy-from-local-backend/.env>
```

### 2. Run Migrations on Production
```bash
# After deployment, run migrations:
python manage.py migrate integrations

# This creates the 5 new database tables:
# - IntegrationProvider
# - IntegrationConnection
# - IntegrationSyncLog
# - WebhookEndpoint
# - IntegrationDataMapping
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Frontend loads at production URL
- [ ] Login/registration works
- [ ] Dashboard displays
- [ ] Integrations page shows grey "Coming Soon" cards
- [ ] Landing page shows "Coming Soon" badges on integration cards
- [ ] No console errors

---

## 📊 What Users Will See

### Integrations Page
- 12 platform cards (Xero, QuickBooks, Sage, AWS, Azure, GCP, Salesforce, HubSpot, Airtable, Slack, Teams, Email)
- **Grey gradient backgrounds** (not colorful)
- **"COMING SOON" yellow badges** on every card
- **Disabled "Coming Soon" buttons** (no Connect functionality)
- Features listed: "Two-way sync", "Real-time updates", "Secure connection"

### Landing Page
- Integration showcase section
- 8 platform cards with icons
- **"COMING SOON" badges** in top-right of each card
- **Grey styling** and reduced opacity on icons

---

## 🔮 Future Activation Steps

### When Ready to Launch Integrations:

1. **Get OAuth Credentials** (see `OAUTH_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
   - Register apps on each platform
   - Add client IDs and secrets to production `.env`
   - Test OAuth flows in staging

2. **Update UI** (remove Coming Soon)
   - Change cards back to colored gradients
   - Remove "COMING SOON" badges
   - Enable "Connect" buttons
   - Test OAuth flows

3. **Configure Celery** (for auto-sync)
   - Set up Redis instance
   - Deploy Celery workers
   - Configure beat scheduler

4. **Announce Launch**
   - Update marketing materials
   - Notify existing users
   - Create user documentation

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes

✅ **Safe to Deploy:**
- Encryption key is only in local `.env` (not in git)
- OAuth credentials are placeholders (empty)
- All secrets properly gitignored
- Documentation doesn't expose real keys
- Public-facing UI shows "Coming Soon"

🔐 **After Deployment:**
- Add encryption key to Vercel secrets
- Never commit real OAuth credentials
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Rotate keys quarterly
